Title: THE BANK

Opening Story: 
After a long day of work, you get home and plop yourself on the couch. 
You unlock your phone to spend the next couple of hours watching TikToks when you get
a notification on your phone: an email from Uvuvwevwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwemubwem Ossas,
the Prince of Nigeria. Prince Uvuvwevwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwemubwem Ossas says that his 
late father deposited $4.2 million in a Bank in West Africa for safe keeping. The Prince 
wanted to transfer the fund into your bank account for investment purposes. However, in
order to do this you would have to transfer all your savings out of your bank account as 
these were the rules for transferring money in Nigeria. Although you knew better, the email
seemed so compelling and realistic that you decided to go for it. Unfortunately, you fell for 
the scam and are now broke. The most logical option right now is to rob a bank so you end up
being a millionaire despite being fooled by the Prince. You decide to go on reddit to search up
things about bank security when you find a subreddit talking about priceless diamonds being stored
in a technologically-sophisticated safe at the Bank of Cupertino. However, in order to rob the bank
and get access to these diamonds, you must find a way to get past this multi-layered safe.
